### Problem
:interrobang: The HTML code of the website differed from what was described in the video. I analyzed it and made the necessary modifications, which made the script functional.


### Results
:white_check_mark: The data scraping code was written with modifications.

:white_check_mark: The issues that arose during the code development have been successfully resolved.

### Thanks
:interrobang:The code idea and its implementation belong entirely to the [PythonToday]
(https://github.com/pythontoday). I used this information for coding practice and made only minor modifications
